Due to the file comparing tool, the entire scope of the file was reduced.

This helped in limiting the area/zone in which the mistake can be.

Once found correcting / changing it back is easier.

Having easy access to the entire history will help us to go back to any version i want.

There are times when a bug gets transported across several versions in a program.

In such a situation going back 4-5 versions helps where we are sure that the program was running smoothly.
